Subject: Request for Work from Home Due to Medical Emergency

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to inform you of a medical emergency in my family. My father has recently undergone heart bypass surgery and is currently in the hospital. Due to the severity of his condition, he requires constant care and support during his recovery. As there is only my mother available to assist him, my presence is crucial to ensure he receives the proper care and attention.

In light of this situation, I kindly request permission to work from home for the next [specify duration, e.g., two weeks] starting from [start date]. Working remotely will allow me to fulfill my job responsibilities while also being present to support my father's recovery.

If there are any specific documents or medical certificates required to process this request, please let me know, and I will arrange to submit them promptly.

I appreciate your understanding and support during this challenging time. Please let me know if there are any additional steps I need to take or any further information you require.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
